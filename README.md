# SmartThingsEdgeDrivers

I recently spent $800 on two sets of Smart Shades from Graywind (https://www.graywindblinds.com/) and while the quality was good, I discovered an issue with the default Smartthings Edge driver when the shade motor is reversed.

Basically, my blinds opened when I clicked close and closed when I clicked open - everything was reversed. 
To my surprise they said NOTHING about this issue on their website. 

So, I contacted their customer support and was told the following:

"I really regret to tell you the shade's running direction is backwards on the bridge app. This is the default. You're not able to change it. " -Graywind Zoe

When asked if they intend to correct this issue, I was told the following:

"Our enginners don't have a plan to fix it for the time being" -Graywind Zoe

This was extremely disappointing from a company who on thir website actually brags "R&D Never Stops". 

Their printed instructions were nearly impossible to understand, but Zoe was able to very clearly articulate the steps I needed to follow to get the shades at least pared with Smartthings, so I am thankful for that.

Anyway, if you learned the hard way of this issue, you can install this driver and solve your problem once and for all.
